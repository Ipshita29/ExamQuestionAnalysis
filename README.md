# Intelligent Exam Question Analysis and Agentic Assessment Design System

This project is an AI-driven educational analytics system that analyzes exam questions and student responses to evaluate question difficulty, identify learning gaps, and support assessment design. The system progresses from ML-based analytics (Milestone 1) to an agentic AI assistant capable of generating structured assessment improvement recommendations (Milestone 2).

## Project Objective
Design and implement an educational analytics system that:
- Analyzes exam question text and student response patterns
- Predicts difficulty or quality levels
- Provides actionable insights for educators
- Extends into an agentic AI assistant for assessment design

## Features
- Text preprocessing and feature extraction (TF-IDF or embeddings)
- Difficulty classification using ML models such as Logistic Regression or Decision Trees
- Student performance pattern analysis
- Basic UI for file upload and results visualization
- Agentic AI assistant for generating structured recommendations
- Optional RAG-based retrieval for improving assessment suggestions

## Datasets
- Dataset Link.

## Milestone 1: ML-Based Exam Question Analytics
- Text preprocessing and feature extraction
- Difficulty prediction or question quality classification
- Student performance pattern analysis
- UI for uploading data and displaying results

## Milestone 2: Agentic AI Assessment Design Assistant
- Difficulty distribution analysis
- Learning gap identification
- Retrieval of assessment design best practices
- Structured recommendations including:
  - Assessment summary
  - Difficulty distribution
  - Learning gaps
  - Suggested improvements
  - References and disclaimers

## Final Deliverables
- Publicly hosted application
- Full GitHub repository
- Demo video (5–7 minutes)
